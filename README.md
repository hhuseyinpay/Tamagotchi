Project:  Tamagotchi Virtual Day Care Center

The subject of the project is to develop a simplified 
Virtual Day Care Center game for one player.

General Information

Our center provides day care for registered children. Children have the following needs: food, game, sleep and hygiene. Day carers provide these needs. As the needs are met, children become happier. The aim of the game is to maximize the happiness level of the children. 

Game Playing Rules

1. Time: Game is turn/time based. A care center day is 50 turns. Each turn is represented as approx. 2 seconds. Everyday starts with the previous day's last values.  

2. Initialization: In initial state; there is 1 child, 1 child carer and 1 office worker in the system. Our initial credit amount is 200. Credits are used to pay carer and workers' daily wage and to buy supplies.

3. Applications: Also there are some applications for children, carers, workers sometimes. Applications appear and stay on the screen for 10 turns. There must be max. 1 application for each kind of application (child/carer/worker). Carer and worker applications appear for a day with the probability of 20%. Child applications appear for a day with the probability of 40%, if the previous day's last average happiness value of the center is greater than 65.     
		Children, carers, workers applications and their unique rates are randomly generated by the system within their limits.

4. Children, Supplies/Needs: There are 4 types of supplies/needs for children: Food, game, sleep and hygiene. These supplies are represented by a value in the system. This value shows the amount of that supply and should be between 25 and 75. This value decreases by time/turn. Each child has different decreasing rates for each supply.

5. Carers, Rates: Each carer has also different rates of meeting the need for different needs. Meeting the need requires some time/turns to transfer/care the supply to the child.
		Each carer can meet only one need of one child at a time. A carer can carry max. 25 units of a supply (sleep doesn't need a supply. But carer is occupied while meeting the need (transfer) duration).
		Carer can only see the parameters of the child in transfer or check session and needs to decide which action to select. A transfer session can be terminated at any time (after min. 2 turns) by the player or it ends when the service is completed.
		Checking child's parameters session takes min. 2 turns of the carer. 
		The only way to learn if a child is missing is the check or transfer session.

6. Happiness: Each child has a happiness value. If a supply is within the limits of 25 and 75, child's happiness increases by the rate of supply's happiness rate. If a supply is greater than 75, child's happiness value decreases by the rate of (2 * supply's happiness rate). If a supply is less than 25, child's happiness value decreases by the rate of (4 * supply's happiness rate). Supply and happiness values can take negative or above 100 values. 

7. Workers: Workers have 2 duties. One of them is buying supplies from market. A worker can carry max. 100 units of supply and requires 10 turns for a purchase process. Another job of the workers is finding missing childs. If a child's happiness is less than 25, he/she can start disappearing period for sometime. Disappearing perod Starting probability is 0.01 for each turn. 
		Each child has a "missing" parameter, normally it is 0. This value increases by one at each turn, if he/she disappears; until a worker is assigned to find the missing child. After the assignment, the missing value decreases by one for each turn. When the value is equal to 0, disappearing period is over.
		Child's needs cannot be met when he/she is missing. Only one need of a child can be met at a time, if he/she is not missing.
	
8. Credits: At the end of the day, if a child's happiness is less than 10, he/she leaves the center and 50 credits are subtracted from our credits as penalty. For other children, each child's happiness contributes to our credits. The amount of the contribution is calculated by the following formula: 
         
    		credit = happiness * (1 + ((happiness-50)/50) )

9. Wages, contracts: Also at the end of the day, carers and workers' daily wages are paid. Carers' wage is 50 credits, workers' wage is 30 credits. If the center's credit is less than 0 and cannot pay the wages, the game is over. You can terminate carer's or worker's contract after paying his/her daily wage, if you want. Also, terminating the contract causes penalty, which is equal to daily wage of the employee.  

10. Score: At the end of the day, score of the day is added to the player's total score.

     	score of the day = number of children * ("end of the day average happiness" - 50)
